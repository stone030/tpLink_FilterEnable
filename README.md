# tpLink_FilterEnable
pre-requisites to run the code:
*  chromedriver.exe -> can be downloaded from the original website https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads (note: if you are using a windows machine, download chromedriver_win32.zip and extract the exe file)
*  python
*  selenium library -> do: ```python -m pip install selenium```

I've uploaded the python code file, its name is **tpLinkAutoFilterEnable.py** below, **but** just to inform you, there are many lines that are commented, and **the code is not ready yet, but yet you can give it a shot and please participate with your suggested edits to make it work :)**

**Note: you better put both chromedriver.exe file and tpLinkAutoFilterEnable.py in the same location/folder**
