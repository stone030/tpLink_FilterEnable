# tpLink_FilterEnable
pre-requisites to run the code:
*  chromedriver.exe -> can be downloaded from the original website https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads (note: if you are using a windows machine, download chromedriver_win32.zip and extract the exe file)
*  python
*  selenium library -> do: ```python -m pip install selenium```

I've uploaded the python code file, its name is **tpLinkAutoFilterEnable.py** here https://github.com/stone030/tpLink_FilterEnable/blob/main/tpLinkAutoFilterEnable.py 

**Note: you better put both chromedriver.exe file and tpLinkAutoFilterEnable.py in the same location/folder**
